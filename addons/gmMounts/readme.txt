- fixed a bug where a mount with the same name but with 2 ids can't be summoned (thanks to Phanx for the input and ideas)
- add the default category " favorites! " which randomly summon a mount from the favorites. 
Basically it is the same of the "Summon Random Favorite Mount" spell, but I need it to use in a macro.
To do it you can also use a simple: 

C_MountJournal.Summon(0) 

but I found it acts more as a switch than a summon. 
So you press once it summon a random favorite you press twice it dismiss.
I have to check it better. 

- add the default category " all! " which randomly summon a mount
- fix the code to prevent to summon the active mount
