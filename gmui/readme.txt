--- About

GmUI is a simple and clean UI for World of Warcraft.
I made it following the idea to use the settings in WTF folder less possible.
This because I usually install this UI on my sons accounts and guildmates.

The addons I have used to make it are:

!BugGrabber
Ara_Broker_Guild_Friends
BigWigs
Broker_Equipment
Broker_StartMenu
Broker_WorldQuests
Bugger
Butsu
ChocolateBar
DaftAuction
ExtraQuestButton
gmAchievementsCompare
gmAggroMon
gmAutopsy
gmBagsSlots
gmDurability
gmExp
gmFonts
gmHideQuestTracking
gmHideToolTip
gmLazyDelete
gmLoot
gmMoney
gmMounts
gmPets
gmProf
gmSpecs
gmSpeed
gmVideoSwitch
GTFO
HideTalkingHead
idTip
Inventorian
oUF_Simple
oUF_SimpleConfig
PhanxChat
rActionBar
rActionBar_Gm_sr
RaidFadeMore
rBuffFrame
rBuffFrame_Default
rButtonTemplate
rButtonTemplate_Gm_rs
rFilter
rFilter_Gm
Remgank
rMinimap
rVignette
Skada
StopResetingMyCameraPlease
Tipsy
tullaRange


All these addons can be found usually on:
WoWInterface
Curse

--- Install

There are a couple ways to install it.

-- Automatic install (windows only)

The install script can't be upload in this archive, because usually sites like WowInterface and Curse prevents to upload .exe/.cmd files.
It is a right policy and I agree with it :)

Btw I have made a little installer script that backups your old settings and then deploys the new interface: Install-gmUI.cmd
You exec it, choose your WoW folder, your account profile and the script can automagically deploy the UI for you.

-- Manual install

- Backup the directory /Interface/Addons then delete it
- Copy the gmUi Addons folder in /Interface

The following steps are optional but I strongly suggests to make them to try the settings of few addons:
- Backup the directory /WTF/Account/YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME/SavedVariables then delete it
- Copy the gmUi SavedVariables folder in /WTF/Account/YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME

The settings are for the following addons:

BigWigs   (settings for bar positions and textures)
ChocolateBar (settings for font and textures)
gmFonts	(change default fonts)
Skada (settings for bar positions and textures)
Tipsy (tooltip positions)
tullaRange (spell range/resources/usability colors)

Play Wow :)
