	- Update Libra to v34.
	- Add key bindings option. (off by default.)
	Wrapped all of the function calls in EasyDisplay lib
	so when 3rd-party addons hook Blizzard's API
	it will call to the latest version that is
	the modified (hooked) function rather than the original function.
	- Fix all the interfaces, they should work correctly now.
	- Fix accessibility so the correct interfaces will open when clicking on the addon's broker display.
	Filtered secured items out of the accessibility dropdowns.
	
	Due to limitation in the game
	some items cannot be opened securely from the menu during combat
	so these items will be disabled once in combat.
	
	When in combat the addon will change its text to "In Combat".
